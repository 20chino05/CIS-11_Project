LC-3 Test Score Analyzer - Project Documentation

Objective

This program streamlines the process of grading student test scores by automatically converting numeric scores to letter grades and providing statistical analysis (min, max, average). It reduces instructor workload and enhances student feedback time.

User Roles

- Instructors: Grade real test scores quickly and efficiently.
- Students: Use to simulate potential scores and track performance.

Program Flow

1. Prompt user to enter 5 test scores (0–99).
2. Convert each score to a letter grade.
3. Store scores and calculate:
   - Minimum
   - Maximum
   - Average (rounded)
4. Display results in a clean format.
5. Ask user if they want to rerun the program.

Functional Summary

- Accepts two digit inputs
- Accepts only integers from 0–99.
- Validates each input.
- Displays error message for invalid entries.
- Calculates and outputs scores and grades in real time.
- Runs inside an LC-3 simulator.

Performance

- Fast input processing and response.
- Outputs calculated statistics within 1 second of final input.
